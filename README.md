# C-Programs-Part-2
C++ programs that I have done through self-learning and the codes that I wrote on my own.

Embarking on a journey to learn C++ independently, I have explored various concepts and applied them through practical coding exercises. This document outlines my learning path, the key concepts I've studied, and some sample codes that demonstrate my understanding and application of C++ programming.

Learning Path

1. Basic Syntax and Data Types

2. Variables and Constants
Data Types (int, float, char, etc.)
Operators (Arithmetic, Logical, Relational)
Control Structures

3. Conditional Statements (if, else, switch)
Loops (for, while, do-while)
Functions

4. Function Declaration and Definition
Parameter Passing (by value and by reference)
Return Types and Recursive Functions
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

5. Classes and Objects
Constructors and Destructors
Inheritance and Polymorphism
Encapsulation and Abstraction
Advanced Topics

6. Pointers and Dynamic Memory Allocation
File I/O
Standard Template Library (STL)
